   * contribution of the block/inline formatting context, which is derived from the
   * container's own font-size. Without this, the browser can add fractional pixels
   * (e.g., 0.5px) to the final height due to font metrics + line-height.
   *
   * Why not use display:flex? It would change expected behavior (alignment, internal
   * ordering, etc.) and could impact other layouts that rely on the current flow. We
   * prefer this minimal approach that fixes the height without visual side effects.
   *
   * Note: Any child element that contains text must explicitly set its own
   * font-size/line-height, since the container has font-size reset to 0 (the build
   * already applies typography on the button's text div).
